                <p class="card-text">As a member of the Dublin High 
                School's Project Lead The Way Engineering Academy, I have taken
                various engineering courses, all with the focus of hands-on 
                learning. Every course is project and team-based. These 
                experiences have definitely pushed me outside my comfort zone 
                and have taught me the importance of effective communication; 
                especially when it comes to presenting my ideas. Over the years,
                I have flourished into a more comfortable speaker who actually 
                looks forward to presenting in front of a crowd; especially 
                when the subject is something that I am passionate about.</p>
                <p class="card-text">During this 2018-2019 school year, 
                I am the leader of the Build Club. I lead the continuation of 
                our Special Olympics Robotic Thrower. I also host workshops to 
                teach my high school peers how to use the various machines, we 
                have at our disposals, such as the 3D printers, Laser Cutter, 
                and CNC Mill. I host these workshops to share my passion for 
                designing and creating practical and useful gadgets. My goal is 
                to create a fun and enjoyable environment where I introduce my 
                peers to the field of engineering.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Above are some of the tests and examples I 
                have made for the purpose of these workshops. Included are 
                examples of some of the slides I use in my presentations when I 
                teach my peers about the machines and technology we will be 
                working with.  The red ring-shaped objects are bracelets and 
                rings I have made to test the material NinjaFlex. This material 
                is extremely stretchy and strong and can be used for a variety 
                of purposes, such as making shoes. The pink and purple figures 
                are examples of a filament that can change color when thermally 
                activated. This specific filament is purple when cold and pink 
                when warm. The objects in blue are examples of some personalized
                key chains I taught my peers how to 3D model and print in our 
                first workshop. And of course, with testing, there are always 
                mistakes. The blue messy blob was my first print. The 3D printer
                I used had no enclosure and required that I put glue on its 
                reusable glass printing bed. The first time, I didnâ€™t put a 
                thick enough layer of glue and the plastic collapsed on top of 
                itself.</p>
