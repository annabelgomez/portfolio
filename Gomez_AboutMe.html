                          <p style="max-width:800">Hello, my name is Annabel 
                          Gomez and I am a senior at Dublin High School. I am 
                          currently in my school's Project Lead the Way (PLTW) 
                          Engineering and Design Academy because I aspire to 
                          become and engineer (perhaps mechanical).  I really
                          enjoy inventing, innovating, and creating. I also
                          enjoy business and leadership; I hope to also be a 
                          CEO of my own engineering firm when I am older. I 
                          appreciate when people hear my voice and ideas. 
                          Although I enjoy this, I still am open to others' 
                          ideas so that I can learn from them and create a 
                          collaborative environment. I plan to achieve my goals 
                          by taking as many PLTW  classes in high school  that
                          will enhance my technical and developmental skills. </p>
                          
                          <p style="max-width:800">My sophomore and junior year,
                          I was the Mechanical Lead of Dublin High School's 
                          Lemelson-MIT Inventeam that built the Special Olympics
                          Robotic Thrower Machine, or SpORT, for short. As the
                          Mechanical Lead, I was in charge of overseeing all c
                          hanges made to the physical aspects of machine. I was 
                          also in charge of designing and building the turntable
                          for the machine. In addition, I was responsible for 
                          fundraising. I was the member who raised the most 
                          money to help cover the cost of building the prototype
                          and traveling to Boston to present it at EurekaFest at
                          MIT.  Being in this team improved my leadership and
                          collaborative skills as I experienced the difference
                          in productivity in our team. We went from having a 
                          lack of communication to being very inclusive and
                          cooperative thanks to the help of our mentor. </p>

                          <p style="max-width:800">Once the grant period ended, 
                          we could no longer call ourselves the Lemelson-MIT 
                          Inventeam team and became a subsection of the Build
                          Club. The Build Club is my high school's main
                          engineering academy club. I became the leader of 
                          the team continuing the maintenance and improvement
                          of the machine we built as the Inventeam. We call 
                          ourselves the Special Olympics Team. On October 9, 
                          2018, we presented SpORT for the first time at a
                          local Special Olympics soccer event for elementary
                          and middle schoolers. This was the first time that 
                          Special Olympics Participants were going to use the 
                          machine and we had to ensure that it met all of the 
                          afety regulations. At the event, my team and I could 
                          ot believe that something we had put countless hours 
                          and many long nights into had materialized into 
                          something that our community would benefit from. 
                          At first, students were intimidated by the loud 
                          motors. The first student approached the machine 
                          and, reluctantly, loaded the ball into place. With 
                          a quick motion, he hit the “Go” button and stepped 
                          back. His fear immediately disappeared and cheers 
                          erupted when the ball hit the target. Soon, other 
                          students lined up to take turns. I could tell, by 
                          how their faces lit up, that they knew that they 
                          were independently completing an otherwise difficult 
                          task. The expression of enthusiasm and genuine 
                          enjoyment, reflected on their faces, gave me a 
                          deep sense of satisfaction. It reinforced my 
                          desire to become an engineer I want my inventions 
                          to improve the lives of others. This achievement 
                          proved to me that I don't have to be an adult to 
                          make a difference! </p>
                          
                          <p style="max-width:800">Impacting others with my work
                          and projects satisfies me. It's why I host workshops 
                          through the Build Club to teach my peers how to use the 
                          various machines we have at our disposal, such as 3D 
                          printers and laser cutters. I hope to show them that
                          there is no one type of engineer. Thank you for your 
                          time to get to know me and please feel free to visit
