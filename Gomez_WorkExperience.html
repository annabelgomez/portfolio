                <p class="card-text">In January, 2019, I obtained a paid 
                engineering internship at MD Resource. This company specializes
                in developing, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing 
                liposuction systems and supplies. I work 3-4 days a week, after 
                school. I report to and am mentored by the General Manager, who 
                is also a Mechanical Engineer. I’m assigned numerous mechanical 
                engineering projects that require me to apply the theoretical 
                concepts and skills learned in my engineering classes. 
                Additionally, I’ve been introduced to various manufacturing 
                techniques such as vacuum forming, pad printing, and silicon 
                mold making. I just completed my first project which involved 
                testing a new coating material used in the canisters distributed
                by the company. I conducted liquid, vacuum, and appearance tests
                to ensure the new coating material met the strict FDA 
                regulations. I maintain a professional Engineering Notebook 
                where I get to write down my observations and findings. This 
                notebook is a crucial part of the process because it allows me 
                to record data that might need to be referenced at a later 
                point. Subsequently, I wrote an official report, detailing my 
                findings, and submitted it to my manager for approval. My next 
                project entails manipulating the pad printing process to see if 
                it can be used in the application of the new coating material. 
                In addition to project-specific tasks, I’ve also been involved 
                in many cleanroom operations and have had the opportunity to 
                learn the mechanics behind various types of equipment built and 
                used by MD Resource. I feel very lucky to have been selected 
                for this internship. Recently, I’ve been doing way more than 
                what’s listed on my job description and I love it!</p>
