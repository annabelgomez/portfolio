                <p class="card-text">In addition to the academy, I've also had the opportunity to participate in academic enrichment programs outside of school. My favorite is the GetSet (Girls Exploring Technology Science and Engineering Together) club. This is a regional extra-curricular enrichment program for high school girls with interests in STEM. Through field trips, networking events and workshops the program is designed to encourage the exploration of a variety of STEM-related careers and demonstrate the link between current classes and future careers. I've had the opportunity to job-shadow various engineers, gaining valuable insight into the industry. Additionally, we have an annual "Dinner with a Scientist" event where a panel of professional women, currently working in the industry, come and answer our questions. The workshops are always challenging but fun. One that I really enjoyed was on digital electronics, as pictured above. We got LEDs, batteries, and copper tape to create a project. I made a large LED heart. The teacher forewarned me about the intricacy of my idea due to the various parallel circuits needed. I, however, successfully completed the project; amazing the teacher and organizers. My determination earned me an interview in a local magazine.
