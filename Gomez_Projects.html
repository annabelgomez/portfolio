                or innovation that would solve a problem in the world. </h5>
                <h5 class="card-text">Type of Project: Team </h5>
                <h5 class="card-text">Role: Team Manager </h5>
                <p class="card-text">Our solution consists of three different 
                accessories that are hard, sharp and can be placed almost 
                anywhere on the body. Our first accessory is called the Fierce 
                Flower by Annabel. This flower had a 3D printed base that had a 
                sharp spike in the middle. Flower petals are attached along the 
                sides of the spike, to design it as a flower. A strip of 
                magnetic tape is also attached to the bottom and customers 
                are provided with magnets so that the flower can be attached 
                anywhere. Ideally, this design is most effective on the shoe 
                since it can be used to kick an attacker in the shins or in 
                the groin in order to disable the attacker and escape. Often 
                in an attack, the attacker has hold of the victim's arms or 
                has immobilized the upper body, which is the most likely source 
                of defense. When the spike is on the foot, this gives a victim a
                chance to fight back with their arms disabled. But due to the
                magnetic strip and clip, the accessory can be attached almost
                anywhere.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Our second accessory is called the Bold 
                Bow. The 3D printed stud center is sharp enough to injure an 
                attacker. To disguise the stud, the ribbon is tied onto the 
                sides to make it look like a regular bow. There is a magnetic 
                clip attached to the back of the bow. The accessory tool can be 
                placed anywhere for easy access. Women can attach the bow to 
                their bracelet with the magnetic clip backing. If an attacker 
                tries to grab the women's wrist, they would prick their hand 
                against the Bold Bow and remove their hand. Then, women can make
                further damage by hitting the attacker's eyes. The bow is 
                created to be placed on the individual and not stored in a bag. 
                Placing the Bold Bow on the individual will make it easier for 
                women to quickly access a tool to defend themselves. The Bold 
                Bow is more effective than the knife bracelet because there is 
                no preparation needed to use the tool. The sharp stud is in the 
                open and ready to be used when needed.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Our third accessory is called the Breaker 
                Bow. This is an entirely 3D printed bow with the two sharp 
                protrusions that are the bottom of the bow. This bow has a 
                strip of magnetic tape attached to the back side and customers 
                are provided with magnets so the bow can be attached almost 
                anywhere. Ideally, this design can be used on your shoes or as 
                a substitute for brass knuckles. The reason it was designed for 
                the shoe is that the way it is oriented, it is ideal for kicking
                your attacker in the shins. The protrusions are pointing 
                outward, aimed directly at an attacker's shins. The breaker 
                bow is also large enough to be held in the fist with the 
                protrusions between the fingers to pack more power, disable 
                your attacker, and get away. The breaker bow gives women the 
                ability to fight back and increases their chances of surviving 
                an attack unscathed.</p>

                <h5 class="card-text">Duration: September 2017</h5>
                <h5 class="card-text">Objective: Create a solid model of an 
                object or small assembly that you want to print on our 3D 
                printer using only one cubic inch of ASB plastic.</h5>
                <h5 class="card-text">Type of Project: Individual</h5>
                <p class="card-text">For the Inch Cubed Project we were 
                instructed to model and 3D print an object that had a volume of 
                1 cubic inch or less. We were allowed to create any object we 
                wanted as long as it was less than or equal to one cubic inch, 
                creative, and was not larger than 6" x 6" x 4". I decided to
                make a picture holder for the many Instax Polaroid photos I 
                have. I wanted to design something sturdy but also decorative. 
                I wanted to ensure that my picture holder would be able to have
                thin enough inserts so that the pictures would be able to go in 
                with ease without falling out. At first, when my part came out 
                of the 3D printer, there was a lot of support material attached
                so I was not sure if the inserts would come out. In the end, the
                pictures fit perfectly. I was also concerned with the wall 
                thickness since I had to make it very thin in order to meet 
                the criteria but because of the shelling I did, the holder is 
                sturdy. I decided to cut Eiffel Tower and heart-shaped holes on
                the front surfaces to make the holder decorative and to decrease
                its overall volume. I was able to catch my mistake with the 
                Eiffel Tower and make it high enough so that the bottom of the 
                holder was not open but with the heart, I forgot to move it 
                upwards.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Next time, I would probably make a smaller 
                shape so that I could use thicker walls and still meet the 
                criteria volume. This is so that my part can be more sturdy and 
                portable without needing to worry if it's going to break. I
                would also make sure that the bottom surface is solid (no holes)
                by moving all the extrusions upwards to the middle of the 
                surface.</p>

                <p class="card-text">For this project, my team and I had to 
                build a car out of VEX parts. Then, we experimented with both 
                hydrogen and solar fuel cells to see which one would be more 
                effective in powering a car. We needed to fix series and 
                parallel configurations for the cells to power the car and
                build a car that could sustain both types of cells. I was the 
                project manager for this project and was in charge of making 
                sure that everyone did equal work and making sure that all tasks
                were completed. For this project, I learned more on how to build
                cars and machines out of VEX parts, which could help me in the 
                future since I want to become a mechanical engineer. This will 
                give me more experience on building things with my hands. 
                Another thing I learned was the difference between series and 
                parallel configurations on breadboards which helps me in the 
                future as well because next time, I will be more experienced on 
                how to power machines I build. One of our main challenges was 
                getting the car to hold the solar and hydrogen cells. We needed 
                to make our car 12 inches long and 5 inches wide and needed to 
                build the car in a way that made it easy for us to quickly 
                change between solar and hydrogen configurations. We were able 
                to build the car with a platform to hold the hydrogen cells and 
                finally, we built a higher platform to hold the solar cells so 
                that they were at an angle where the sunlight would hit them 
                correctly. As a team, we learned that everyone's ideas matter 
                and should be taken into consideration. This led me to show my 
                organization and teamwork skills to make sure that my team was 
                on task, everyone contributed equally, and that everyone's ideas
                were taken into consideration.</p>

                <h5 class="card-text">Project Role: Team Member</h5>
                <p class="card-text">For this project, my team was tasked to 
                model virtual trains that are appropriate for kids to play with.
                I was responsible for modeling my own car that resembles 
                different animals of a usual zoo. I was also tasked with making 
                my own Technical Drawings for this part of the project as well 
                as my part of the presentation. I needed to use Inventor Studio
                where I made videos of my trains to showcase the different 
                views. During the process of this project, I learned how to read
                dimensions on technical drawings (part outlines) so that I could
                make my own train engine parts. Another important task that I 
                learned to do was how to use Inventor Studio to showcase my 
                different modeled projects and how to make more advanced models
                with more texture to them by making unique personal colors for 
                them. A challenge that I overcame during this project was how 
                to read dimensions. I was very confused at first because I 
                didn't understand what all the symbols and lines meant but I 
                kept on practicing and taking my time to fully understand where
                I was getting my measurements from and I was finally able to 
                figure out what each dimension meant. At the same time, I was
                having a hard time using more advanced skills on Inventor so 
                while I was learning how to read dimensions, I also learned how
                to use/ show different techniques on Inventor such as: adding a
                picture to a molded part so that it looks like a color, learning
                how to combine technical drawings, and how to be more creative 
                with my models to make more complicated designs by making my 
                modeling more accurate with new constraints. My leadership 
                skills were also shown during this project. Since it was a 
                group project, I decided to be a group manager. I made sure that
                everyone was given and doing an even amount of work and that 
                everyone was completing the work assigned on time. For example,
                I was on a trip for one week of this project and was out of town
                so I made sure that I was productive so that I could finish all
                the work that would need to be done that week. I made sure my 
                team was still able to carry on with their work and not be 
                limited to only doing a certain amount of work by leaving them 
                my work. Upon my return, I was able to help my team out with 
                their work so that we could finish on time.  As a team, we 
                learned how to understand people's situations when it came 
                to work and help each other out even when we weren't assigned
                that specific task.</p>

                <h5 class="card-text">Project Role: Team Manager</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> For this project, my team and we had to 
                invent or innovate a product that would solve any problem that 
                existed. We were asked to come up with a product and then model 
                it and present it to our class. For this product, I was a 
                project manager and helped make sure that work was divided 
                evenly, everyone stayed on task, and that all work was 
                completed. When we were first assigned the project, we thought 
                it would be easier to come up with a product but soon learned 
                that when you are faced with a problem, you don't always go 
                with the first idea. There are many different aspects that you 
                need to look at. You need to figure out exactly how the product
                will work and how the product will change if there is a problem.
                You need to be flexible and open to new ideas. When you are 
                brainstorming, you can't just grab on to the first idea you 
                like. One of the challenges we needed to overcome was to come 
                up with a product that would truly work. We needed to 
                communicate how exactly the product would work because 
                sometimes, you have an idea in your head but it is hard to share
                out loud the specific way it would work.  To overcome this 
                challenge, we took our time brainstorming and thoroughly 
                thinking about the pros and cons of each product. We learned 
                when to let go of one idea and go on to the next. Some of the 
                special skills that I contributed were creativeness when it came
                to brainstorming products and organization. I learned that 
                there can be a problem anywhere and to that problem there are 
                solutions. This is what allowed me to think of a variety of 
                different ideas. I also showed my organization skills by 
                setting a due date to everything and making sure my team met

                everyone's standards and strengths. We understood and respected

                <h5 class="card-text">Objective: Design and model an invention 
                or innovation that would solve a problem in the world.</h5>
                <h5 class="card-text">Type of Project: Group Project</h5>
                <h5 class="card-text">Project Role: Team Manager</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> For this project, my team and we had to 
                invent or innovate a product that would solve any problem that 
                existed. We were asked to come up with a product and then model 
                it and present it to our class. For this product, I was a 
                project manager and helped make sure that work was divided 
                evenly, everyone stayed on task, and that all work was 
                completed. When we were first assigned the project, we thought 
                it would be easier to come up with a product but soon learned 
                that when you are faced with a problem, you don't always go 
                with the first idea. There are many different aspects that you 
                need to look at. You need to figure out exactly how the product
                will work and how the product will change if there is a problem.
                You need to be flexible and open to new ideas. When you are 
                brainstorming, you can't just grab on to the first idea you 
                like. One of the challenges we needed to overcome was to come 
                up with a product that would truly work. We needed to 
                communicate how exactly the product would work because 
                sometimes, you have an idea in your head but it is hard to share
                out loud the specific way it would work.  To overcome this 
                challenge, we took our time brainstorming and thoroughly 
                thinking about the pros and cons of each product. We learned 
                when to let go of one idea and go on to the next. Some of the 
                special skills that I contributed were creativeness when it came
                to brainstorming products and organization. I learned that 
                there can be a problem anywhere and to that problem there are 
                solutions. This is what allowed me to think of a variety of 
                different ideas. I also showed my organization skills by 
                setting a due date to everything and making sure my team met 
                that deadline. As a team, we worked well together understanding
                everyone's standards and strengths. We understood and respected
                everyone's ideas and made sure that everyone contributed 
                equally.</p>
