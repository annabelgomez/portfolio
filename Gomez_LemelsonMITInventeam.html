                <!--Paragraph 1-->
                <p class="card-text">I was the Mechanical Lead of Dublin High 
                School's Lemelson-MIT Inventeam that built the Special Olympics 
                Robotic Thrower Machine, or SpORT, for short. As the Mechanical 
                Lead, I was in charge of overseeing all changes made to the 
                physical aspects of machine. Our team had an electronic 
                documentation process. At every meeting, I would document our 
                future plans for the machine, as well as record any changes made
                to the machine. I was also in charge of designing and building 
                the turntable for the machine. I built a belt and pulley system,
                powered by a motor going at 3 rpm. In addition, I was 
                responsible for fundraising. I was the member who raised the 
                most money to cover the rest of the cost of building the 
                prototype and traveling to Boston to present it at EurekaFest</p>
                
                <!--Paragraph 2-->
                <p class="card-text">After eighteen months of brainstorming, 
                designing, prototyping, fundraising, presenting to our community,
                and planning, we finally presented our final prototype at 
                EurekaFest at MIT. Once the grant period ended, we could no 
                longer call ourselves the Lemelson-MIT Inventeam team and became
                a subsection of the Build Club. The Build Club is my high 
                school's main engineering academy club. I became the leader of 
                the team continuing the maintenance and improvement of the 
                machine we had built as the Inventeam. We call ourselves the 
                Special Olympics Team.</p>
                
                <!--Paragraph 3-->
                <p class="card-text">When SpORT came back from Boston, a few 
                adjustments needed to be done. My team and I found out about an 
                approaching local Special Olympics soccer event for elementary 
                and middle schoolers in October. We got right to work, ensuring 
                the functionality and safety of the machine for the upcoming 
                event. This was the first time that Special Olympics Participants
                were going to use the machine and we had to ensure that it met 
                all of the safety regulations. </p>
                
                <!--Paragraph 4-->
                <p class="card-text">At the event, my team and I could not 
                believe that something we had put countless hours and many long 
                nights into had materialized into something that our community 
                would benefit from. The eighteen months had all come down to 
                this. While setting up our machine, the surprised gasps from the
                teachers, community members, and students excited me. I could not
                wait for them to see what our machine could do. At first, 
                students were intimidated by the loud motors. The first student 
                approached the machine and, reluctantly, loaded the ball into 
                place. With a quick motion, he hit the “Go” button and stepped 
                back. His fear immediately disappeared and cheers erupted when 
                the ball hit the target. Soon, other students lined up to take 
                turns. I could tell, by how their faces lit up, that they knew 
                that they were independently completing an otherwise difficult 
                task. The expression of enthusiasm and genuine enjoyment, 
                reflected on their faces, gave me a deep sense of satisfaction.</p>
                
                <!--Paragraph 5-->
                <p class="card-text">I want to become an engineer because I want 
                to make the world a better place. I want my inventions to improve
                the lives of others. This achievement proved to me that I don't 
                have to be an adult to make a difference!</p>
                
                <!--Paragraph 6-->
                <p class="card-text">These participants may not be able to play 
                soccer, physically, but this machine gives them the opportunity
                to enjoy the sport more interactively!</p>
